# Capstone_project_17030125490
This is the capstone project which I completed during my python studies in MBA.
This was the part of Coursera course called- Python for everybody by University of Michigan

Project Description:
Exploratory Data Analysis on health insurance coverage across 8,800+ Americans, uncovering how education, employment, region, and ethnicity shape access to healthcare.

Overview:
This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Health Insurance survey dataset containing 8,802 records across 12 demographic and socioeconomic variables. The goal is to uncover the key factors that influence whether an individual has health insurance coverage and how that coverage connects to overall health outcomes.

Dataset:
- **Source:** Health Insurance Survey Data
- **Records:** 8,802
- **Features:** age, gender, education, region, ethnicity, marital status, employment type, family size, health status, insurance coverage, and financial limit indicator.

Key Questions Explored:
- Who is most likely to be uninsured in America?
- Does education level affect insurance access?
- Are self-employed individuals at a disadvantage?
- Which regions have the lowest coverage rates?
- Is there a link between insurance status and health outcomes?
- Do ethnic and gender disparities exist in coverage?

Analysis Sections:
1. Data Overview & Quality Check
2. Univariate Analysis
3. Bivariate Analysis
4. Multivariate Analysis
5. Health Status Deep Dive
6. Key Findings & Policy-Level Conclusion

Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Key Findings:
- 25% of respondents are uninsured
- Higher education strongly correlates with insurance access
- Self-employed individuals are significantly more likely to be uninsured
- Insured individuals report better health outcomes
- Clear regional and ethnic disparities exist in coverage rates
